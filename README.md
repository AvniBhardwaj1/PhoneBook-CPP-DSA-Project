# Phone Book App by Avni

The Phone Book App is a simple web application that allows users to manage their contacts, search for contacts, and perform basic operations like adding, deleting, and viewing contact details.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Users can add a new contact by entering a name and a 10-digit phone number. The application checks for valid phone numbers.

- **Search Contacts**: Users can search for contacts by either name or phone number. The search is not case-sensitive when searching by name.

- **Delete Contacts**: Users can select one or more contacts and delete them from the phone book. A confirmation prompt is displayed before deletion.

- **Show All Contacts**: Users can display all contacts stored in the phone book.

- **Count Contacts**: Users can count the number of contacts in the phone book, and the count is displayed as a notification.
